 * Reference-counted owning container similer to std::shared_ptr for a
 * contiguous block of data. Thread-safe refcounting is used (via atomic). The
 * control block holds the pointer, the count, the deleter, and the memory
 * location. Copies increment the refcount, moves are cheap.
 *
 * Important behaviour:
 * - `release()` can transfer ownership out as a `released_buffer<T>` *only* if
 * this is the unique owner (use_count == 1); otherwise release fails and
 * returns std::nullopt.
 *
 * Implementation detail:
 * - The control block is allocated by this class (via new). The control block
 * will be destroyed either:
 * * when last owner drops the refcount to zero (then the deleter is invoked),
 * * or when `release()` successfully transfers ownership (the control block
 * is deleted but the deleter is moved into the returned raw_buffer).
